First, this package doesn't do much except add a template Github Action to
build all the pieces necessary for a workshop.

## Quickstart

- [ ] Clone this repo, fork and rename it, or create a repo from this template
- [ ] Edit `DESCRIPTION` file
  - [ ] Change package name
  - [ ] Change title and description
  - [ ] Change authors
  - [ ] Check dependencies
  - [ ] Change DockerImage tag
- [ ] Edit `.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml`
- [ ] Write a normal R package that can be installed
- [ ] Include one or more vignettes that will constitute the workshop materials

## Details

### Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/seandavi/BuildABiocWorkshop2020 MYPKGDIR
```

### Edit `DESCRIPTION` file

- Change the package name to something identifiable and descriptive, ideally 
something that will be somewhat unique. 
- Edit the title and description as per any normal R package.
- Update authors (unless you want me to get credit for your work).
- Workshop packages are normal R packages, so dependencies work as usual. If
you are going to depend on something on github, be sure to specify the correct
repo `username/reponame`. Installation will deal with this.

### Edit `.github/workflows/basic_checks.yaml`

**You MUST change the `repository` line in this yaml file to be YOUR
desired Docker image name**. In other words, this section of the
github actions file will build and push to dockerhub the image with
this name.

**NOTE**: Dockerhub names must be all lowercase, can be two to 255
  characters, and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers or `-` and
  `_` (https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/).


```yaml
     - uses: docker/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
          # change the next line to reflect the name
          # of YOUR dockerhub repository
          repository: seandavi/buildabiocworkshop2020
          tag_with_ref: true
          tag_with_sha: true
          tags: latest
```

Also change the repo name here (here it is case-insensitive):

```yaml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.r-project.org"))
          BiocManager::repositories()
          BiocManager::install("seandavi/BuildABiocWorkshop2020", dependencies = TRUE, update = TRUE, ask = FALSE)
          remotes::install_cran("rcmdcheck")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

### Edit `Dockerfile`

Change `seandavi/BuildABiocWorkshop2020` to the username/reponame of
your GitHub repo, to install your workshop and all its
Depends/Imports/Suggests and their dependencies into the Docker
container for your workshop.

You can also choose to build on a different base Bioconductor Docker
image. For example, to build on release 3.11 instead of devel, change
`FROM bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:devel` to `FROM
bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_11`.

### Add "secrets" to github repo

Secrets are encrypted environment variables that you create in a
repository or organization. The secrets you create are available to
use in GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub uses a libsodium sealed box to
help ensure that secrets are encrypted before they reach GitHub, and
remain encrypted until you use them in a workflow.
 
See [Creating and storing encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: your dockerhub username; create a dockerhub account if you do not have one
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: your dockerhub password or an access token obtained from [Docker Hub][]
